            <h2>About Basic Needs</h2>
            <p>The Basic Needs website by Student Life at the University of Michigan addresses the essential needs that facilitate everyday living and ensure students' fundamental requirements are met. Basic Needs promotes fair and equitable access to food and other basic resources. Because when each of us has what we need, our community is stronger and our students are more successful. The website has been created to share information about the resources available to students. It’s also a place to share data and research that will help the U-M community understand how important this work is for the entire campus.</p>
